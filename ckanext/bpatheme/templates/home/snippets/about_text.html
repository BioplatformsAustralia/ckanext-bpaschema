<p>
The 
<a href="https://bioplatforms.com/projects/">
Bioplatforms Australia Framework Initiatives 
</a>
are national collaborative 
projects that use integrated ‘omics infrastructure to generate high-impact 
data and knowledge resources to support some of Australia’s biggest 
scientific challenges. These challenges span agriculture, biomedicine, 
the environment and industry, as well as extending to relevant 
international endeavours.
</p>

<p>
These interdisciplinary and collaborative initiatives deliver large-scale 
open science programs that:
<ul>
    <li>
        deliver lasting outcomes that serve as a leading and 
	trusted resource;
    </li>
    <li>
        cultivate meaningful collaborations and partnerships beyond 
	discipline and institutional boundaries;
    </li>
    <li>
        support translation of research into impact; and
    </li>
    <li>
        encourage innovation through an agile and future-looking 
	implementation framework.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The resulting datasets are stored (or linked to within) this 
<a href="/">Data Portal</a>
and are all accompanied by a rich set of metadata to enhance reuse.
